                    "I want to be known by you" — not just in whispered promises, but in the quiet spaces between heartbeats. Let me memorize the constellations of your laughter, the rhythm of your thoughts, and every dream that flickers behind your eyes. You are the story I never tire of reading, the song that plays softly in my bones.
                    When storms gather and shadows stretch long, "I’ll be there for you in your darkest times." Not as a shield, but as steady hands to hold yours, as a voice to whisper, "We are stronger than this night." I will walk with you through fire and frost, because your courage is my compass, and your heart is my home.
                    And when the sun returns — oh, my love — "I will make you ruler of everything you see." Not of kingdoms or crowns, but of a world where your joy paints the sky, where your worth outshines every star. You are already royalty in the way you love, in the way you turn ordinary moments into sacred things.
                    You are my safe harbor in chaos, my quiet rebellion against a world that tries too hard to be cold. Thank you for existing exactly as you are — flawed, fierce, and infinitely beautiful. Today, tomorrow, and in all the lifetimes after this one: I choose you. Always you.This may not seem like much,but I'll definately make it up to you. 💛</p>
